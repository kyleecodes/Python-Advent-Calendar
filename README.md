## Python Advent Calendar Challenge - Data Science Edition! 24 challenges for 24 days :) 

|  Date  |  Challenge  |
|--------|-------------|
| Dec01  |    Write a function called generate_arr(start, end) that takes as input two integers start, end and returns a NumPy array (1 dimensional) containing all integers between those values including start and end.         |
| Dec02  |    Missing data is an everyday problem that data scientists need to deal with. Write a function called replace_nans(array) that takes as input a NumPy array and returns it after replacing all np.nan (numpy.nan) values with -1.         |
| Dec03  |    Write a funtion called generate_matrix_9x9() that generates a 9x9 matrix with all elements equal 2 except the one in the middle which should be equal 0.          |
| Dec04  |    Write a funtion called get_elements(arr) that returns the median of all the elements of the input array which are greater than 2.         |
| Dec05  |    Write a function called compute_percentage_unique_elements(arr) that returns the percentage of all unique entries of an array (as float).        |
| Dec06  |    Write a function called half_xmas_tree(depth) that takes as argument an integer and prints half of a christmas tree of given depth using 1s (for the xmas tree) and 0s (for the background).          |
| Dec07  |   Write a function called weighted_average(arr) that returns the weighted average of an input array where all elements besides the first and the last have the same weight and the weight of the 2 remaining ones is 5x bigger.          |
| Dec08  |     Write a funtcion called calculate_magda_metric(arr) that takes as input a matrix and computes magda_metric which is the mean of the values in the first column multiplied by the sum of the values in the last row.         |
| Dec09  |      Write a function called initialize_weights(rows, columns) that returns a rows x columns matrix containing weights which are random uniform distributed over the half-open interval.       |
| Dec10  |     Write a function called can_multiply(m1, m2) that takes as input a x b matrix m1 and c x d matrix m2 and returns true if it is possible to multiply m1 and m2 and false otherwise.        |
| Dec11  |    Write a function called multiply_with_transpose(m) that returns matrix m multiplied with its transpose.         |
| Dec12  |    Write a function called create_series(data) that takes as input a dictionary and converts it to a Pandas series.         |
| Dec13  |    Write a function called create_and_sort_series(data) that takes as input a list of values, converts it to a Series, adds value 2 to the series, and returns a sorted version of it (descending!).         |
| Dec14  |    Write a function called occurrences(data) that converts data (a dictionary) into series and returns the frequency count of of every number in this series.         |
| Dec15  |     Write a function called where_is_2(series) that returns the position (integer) of the number 2          |
| Dec16  |     Write a function called get_joining_date(data) that takes as input a dictionary, turns it into Pandas dataframe, sets name as index, and returns the date on which Peter has joined the challenge.         |
| Dec17  |     "ser" has missing dates and values, make all missing dates appear and fill up with value from previous dates        |
| Dec18  |     Compute autocorrelations for the first 10 lags of ser. Find out which lag has the largest correlation.        |
| Dec19  |     Import every 50th row of BostonHousing dataset as a dataframe.        |
| Dec20  |     Filter words that contain at least 2 vowels from a series.        |
| Dec21  |     Filter non-emails from a series of emails.        |
| Dec22  |     Find all the local maxima (or peaks) in a numeric series.        |
| Dec23  |     Use the apply function on existing columns with global variables as additional arguments.        |
| Dec24  |     Create a new column that contains the row number of nearest column by euclidean distance.        |
